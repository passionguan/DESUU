-About the software framework tool

-DESUU: Design for Embedded Systems Under Uncertainties

-Note: The tool is compiled on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 14.04.
-It is understood you are working on a linux machine.

-Install prerequisites library
 
 -Before compling and running the framework, you need to first install libx11-dev on your Linux Ubuntu machine. Please use the following command to install the package:

 -sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
 
 -Then, you may need to download the Boost library from this website:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.61.0/boost_1_61_0.tar.bz2/download
 
  In the directory where you want to put the Boost installation, execute:
 
  tar --bzip2 -xf /YOUR_PATH_TO/boost_1_61_0.tar.bz2
 (YOUR_PATH_TO is the path you want to store the Boost)
 
  For more information about Boost, please refer to: 
 
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 -How to compile and run the program
 
  -Makefile has been provided for compiling the program on linux (and unix-like)
  systems. Edit the "CLASSDIR", "INCDIRS" and "X11_INCLUDE" base on your own path.
 
  CLASSDIR: The path you store the DESUU tool. For instance, if you store the tool in /home/passionguan/Downloads/DESUU , then edit CLASSDIR = /home/passionguan/Downloads/DESUU
 
  INCDIRS: The path to the include headfiles. The headfiles are stored in the "include" file inside DESUU, so you should set INCDIRS = $(CLASSDIR)/include
 
  BOOST: The path to the BOOST library. For instance, if you store the BOOST library in  /home/passionguan/Downloads/DESUU/include/boost_1_61_0 , then set BOOST = -I/home/passionguan/Downloads/DESUU/include/boost_1_61_0
 
  Please use the command "make" in the terminal to compile all the source files. Then you will get the executable file named "desuu".
 
  Usage: ./desuu random_seed < input_file.in
  Example: ./desuu 0.5 < input_data/test.in
  Explanation: desuu is the executable file; random_seed is a real number in (0,1) which is used as a seed for random number generator; input_file.in is the file that stores all the input parameters. You can also use "./desuu random_seed" to set the parameters in the terminal.
 
  NOTE: we have used the open source nsga2 algorithm code from Dr. Kalyanmoy Deb.

  -About the output files
 
  best_pop.out: This file contains the best solutions obtained at the end of simulation run.
  inial_pop.out: This file contains all the information about initial population.
  final_pop.out: This file contains the data of final population.
  all_pop.out: This file containts the data of populations at all generations.
  params.out: This file contains the information about input parameters as read by the program.
 
  The best_pop.out file contains all the non-dominate solutions, which consist of the Pareto frontier.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  -About the input parameters
 
  -popsize: This variable stores the population size (a multiple of 4);
  -ngen: Number of generations;
  -nobj: Number of objectives;
  -ncon: Number of constraints;
  -nreal: Number of real variables;
  -min_realvar[i]: minimum value of i^{th} real variable;
  -max_realvar[i]: maximum value of i^{th} real variable;
  -pcross_real: probability of crossover of real variable;
  -pmut_real: probability of mutation of real variable;
  -eta_c: distribution index for real variable SBX crossover;
  -eta_m: distribution index for real variable polynomial mutation;
  -nbin: number of binary variables;
  -nbits[i]: number of bits for i^{th} binary variable;
  -min_binvar[i]: minimum value of i^{th} binary variable;
  -max_binvar[i]: maximum value of i^{th} binary variable;
  -pcross_bin: probability of crossover for binary variable;
  -pmut_bin: probability of mutation for binary variable;
